## What's in MF3D R2?

A major limitation of the method used to produce the first stimulus set ([MF3D R1](https://github.com/MonkeyGone2Heaven/MF3D-Tools/wiki/MF3D-Release-%231)) was that facial expression and facial identity could not be co-varied simultaneously. Consequently, MF3D R1 contained an [expression subset](https://github.com/MonkeyGone2Heaven/MF3D-Tools/wiki/MF3D-Release-%231#expression-subset) in which facial identity was held constant (identity M02) and a separate [identity subset](https://github.com/MonkeyGone2Heaven/MF3D-Tools/wiki/MF3D-Release-%231#identity-subset) in which expression was held constant (neutral expression). Using a computational operation known as 'expression cloning' (or more generally 'shape deformation transfer'), we are now able to transfer facial expressions across identities to generate a novel stimulus set of CGI macaque faces with unparalleled parametric control.

## Expression x Identity subset

The static stimuli of MF3D R2 will extend those of release 1 by covarying the following variables:
* expression types
* expression intensities
* head orientations
* identity dimensions
* identity distinctiveness levels
* lighting directions

## Animation subset
The animated component of the MF3D R2 stimulus set will replicate the [animation subset](https://github.com/MonkeyGone2Heaven/MF3D-Tools/wiki/MF3D-Release-%231#animation-subset) of MF3D R1, but will include a variety of facial identities of the avatar.
