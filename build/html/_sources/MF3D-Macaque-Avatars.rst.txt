In order to advance our limited understanding of how complex primate brains
like ours work to coordinate social interactions, we need animal models that
allow us to ethically study the neural correlates at the cellular level. 
Non-human primates represent a crucial resource in this endeavor, and the Rhesus 
monkey (*Macaca mulatta*, of the macaque genus of Old World monkeys) is one of the most promising and popular (Figure 1; `NIH, 2017 <https://orip.nih.gov/sites/default/files/508%20NHP%20Evaluation%20and%20Analysis%20Final%20Report%20-%20Part%201.pdf>`_). 

In the wild, Rhesus macaques have the second largest territorial range of any primate on earth (after humans). They live in large troops of up to several hundred individuals, which are organized by strict social hierarchies and governed by rules of social interaction. They rely predominantly on their high acuity vision for gathering information about the intentions and internal states of their conspecifics.


Face processing in the macaque brain
-------------------------------------

Neural responses to images of faces were first reported by Gross and colleagues in 1972. 



Development of Macaque Avatars
------------------------------

Digital macaque 'avatars' have been used in behavioral and neuroscience research for over a decade (:ref:`Figure 1 <avatars-fig>`). 

Since the earliest uses of macaque avatars, advances in graphic processing power and decreases in cost have lead to increased accessibility and photorealistic quality of rendering for complex particle systems (such as hair and fur) and naturalistic lighting (such as subsurface scattering). Given a studio budget, state of the art CGI is now almost `indistinguishable from video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjHiC0mt4Ts>`_, while low-budget projects utilizing open-source tools such as `Blender <www.blender.org>`_ have raised the quality of CGI renders.

Despite these technological advances, the time and cost of employing skilled digital professionals to generate realistic 3D models of macaques can be prohibitive for some labs. The duplication of these efforts across many labs who then seek to protect their investments is ultimately wasteful for the research community. MF3D is the first ever publicly available macaque avatar resource for the scientific research community.
