MF3D Release 2
==============

What's in MF3D R2?
------------------

A major limitation of the method used to produce the first stimulus set (:doc:`MF3D R1 </MF3D-Release-1>`) was that facial expression and facial identity could not be co-varied
simultaneously. Consequently, MF3D R1 contained an :ref:`expression subset <mf3d-r1-expression>` in which facial identity was held constant (identity M02) and a separate
:ref:`identity subset <mf3d-r1-identity>`
in which expression was held constant (neutral expression). Using a
computational operation known as 'expression cloning' (or more generally
'shape deformation transfer'), we are now able to transfer facial
expressions across identities to generate a novel stimulus set of CGI
macaque faces with unparalleled parametric control.

Expression x Identity subset
----------------------------

.. todo::

	The static stimuli of MF3D R2 will extend those of release 1 by
covarying the following variables:

-  expression types

-  expression intensities

-  head orientations

-  identity dimensions

-  identity distinctiveness levels

-  lighting directions

Animation subset
----------------

The animated component of the MF3D R2 stimulus set replicates the
:ref:`animation subset <mf3d-r1-animation>` of MF3D R1, but includes a variety of facial identities of the avatar.
