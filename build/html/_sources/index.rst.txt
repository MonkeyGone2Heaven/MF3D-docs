The Macaque Face 3D project is an effort to develop a parametrically controlled,
anatomically accurate, three-dimensional, virtual avatar of the Rhesus macaque face and head, for
visual stimulation in behavioral neuroscience experiments involving this important model species.
The avatar has been used to produced the first ever publicly available database of computer generated 
images of macaque facial expression and identity, which you can learn more about below.

Full details of how the model and rendered images were generated have been published here:

    of the Rhesus macaque face for investigating the visual processing
    of social cues. *J.Neurosci.Methods*, 324: 108309. `DOI:

The graphical abstract figure below illustrates how biometric data from real animals were acquired, analyses and parameterized to generate a realistic digital model. For more details, browse the table of contents.
