Overview
========

We provide a graphical user interface (GUI) programmed in Matlab
(MF3D\_ParamEstimtion.m) to allow collaborators to estimate the temporal
dynamics of facial motion from video footage of macaque monkeys. The GUI
is intended to be used on short video clips that have been pre-selected
as containing an individual facial movement, expression or vocalization
of interest. The GUI requires users to scroll through the clip and
manually input information about the various facial parameters, either
by tracking the position of facial landmarks across frames, or by
estimating their change over time subjectively.

The GUI saves the time courses for all tracked parameters to a
spreadsheet (.csv format). While the avatar Blender file is not yet
publicly released, collaborators can send us their time course data,
which we read into Blender via a Python script and apply as keyframes
for generating video animations of the macaque avatar.
